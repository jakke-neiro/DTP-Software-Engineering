# Modelling of the immune system
## Introduction
The modelling project is based on Paul R. Buckley’s DPhil thesis
”The Mechanistic Modelling and Simulation of Vaccine-Adjuvant
Induced Immune Responses”. In vaccinology, an adjuvant is an
immunostimulant that shapes and enhances the immune repsponse, and
therefore adjuvants are commonly included in vaccines to increase their
efficacy. However, the details of the mechanism and mode of action (MoA)
of several adjuvants remain unknown. In his thesis, Buckley examines
the MoA of the liposome-based adjuvant ASO1 and its two components MPL
and QS21 in the murine lymph node using a systems biology approach.
