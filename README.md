# Modelling of the immune system
## Introduction
The modelling project is based on Paul R. Buckley’s DPhil thesis ”The Mech-anistic  Modelling  and  Simulation  of  Vaccine-Adjuvant  Induced  Immune  Re-sponses”.  In vaccinology, an adjuvant is an immunostimulant that shape andenhance the immune repsponse, and therefore adjuvants are commonly includedin vaccines to increase their efficacy.  However, the detailed of mechanism and mode  of  action  (MoA)  of  several  adjuvants  remains  unknown. In  his  thesis,Buckley examines the MoA of the liposome-based adjuvant ASO1 and its twocomponents MPL and QS21 in the murine lymph node using a systems biology approach.
